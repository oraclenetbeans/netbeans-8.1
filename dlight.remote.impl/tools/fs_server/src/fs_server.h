 * Response is textual.

 * Responses can be single and multiple.
 * Single response describes one file (e.g. result of 'stat' request)
 * Multiple response describes list of files (e.g. result of 'ls' request)
 *
 * First fields (kind, id and length) are space separated
 * All figures are in decimal human readable format (e.g. "234")

 * kind         response kind (1 char); for values, see see fs_response_kind
 *              1-character gap
 * id           the id of the request this response responds to

 * abspath      absoulte path of the file this response refers to

 * LF           line feed character
 *
 * Each response element has the following format:
 *
 * file_type    1-character file type
 *              1-character gap
 * access       9-character access (e.g. "rwxr-xr-x")
