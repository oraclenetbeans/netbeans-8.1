ERR_BadRestritedFieldType=Field\'s bean class specifies @Typed annotation, \
and the value member specifies a class which does not correspond to a type in \
the unrestricted set of bean types of a bean. 
ERR_DelegateHasNoInject=Field is declared as @Delegate but it is not an injection point. 
ERR_DelegateIsNotInDecorator=Field is declared as @Delegate but its enclosing \
type element is not a decorator. 
ERR_NonStaticProducerSessionBean=A producer field must be a static field of the \
session bean class. 

ERR_ProducerHasTypeVar=A producer field type should not be a type variable.
ERR_ProducerHasWildcard=A producer field type should not contain a wildcard type parameter.

ERR_WrongScopeParameterizedProducer=The producer field has parameterized type \
with a type variable and has scope {0} (should be @Dependent).

and qualifier @Default but bean declares not @Dependent scope. 

ERR_DelegateTypeHasNoDecoratedType=The delegate type of a decorator must implement \
or extend every decorated type of decorator. 

ERR_FinalDecoratedBean=Delegate injection point matches a managed bean {0} \
which class is declared final.

ERR_FinalMethodDecoratedBean=Delegate injection point matches a managed bean {0} \
with final method {1} which is implemented by decorator.

WARN_NamedInjectionPoint=The use of @Named as an injection point qualifier is not recommended.
