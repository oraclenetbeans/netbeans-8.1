INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, this will be done periodically; just
change the XML. If you can, validate the XML against the DTD, if not
do not worry about it. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

      <change id="mergeCustomHelpset">
          <api name="general"/>
          <summary>Added class <code>HelpUtils</code></summary>
          <version major="2" minor="34"/>

          <description>
              <p>
                  Provide a method for merging of a custom HelpSet object to the
                  master helpset.
              </p>

          <class package="org.netbeans.api.javahelp" name="HelpUtils"/>

      </change>

      <change id="HelpSetRegistration">
          <api name="general"/>
          <summary>Added <code>@HelpSetRegistration</code></summary>
          <version major="2" minor="20"/>
          <date day="8" month="11" year="2010"/>
          <author login="jglick"/>
          <compatibility>
              <p>
                  Modules registering help sets in their XML layers are encouraged to migrate to the new annotation.
                  Delete the <code>&lt;helpsetref&gt;</code> file from your layer, move your help set files
                  into the project's regular source/resource root, remove <code>OpenIDE-Module-Requires: org.netbeans.api.javahelp.Help</code> from your module's manifest,
                  add a direct dependency on this module, and add a <code>package-info.java</code> with the annotation.
                  For Ant-based module projects, <code>javahelp.base</code> and <code>javahelp.hs</code> can also be removed from <code>project.properties</code>.
              </p>
          </compatibility>
          <description>
              <p>
                  There is a new annotation to make it easier to register help sets.
              </p>

        <change id="object">
