/**
 * Provide bracket completion for Ruby. This class provides three broad
 * services: - Identifying matching pairs (parentheses, begin/end pairs etc.),
 * which is used both for highlighting in the IDE (when the caret is on for
 * example an if statement, the corresponding end token is highlighted), and
 * navigation where you can jump between matching pairs. - Automatically
 * inserting corresponding pairs when you insert a character. For example, if
 * you insert a single quote, a corresponding ending quote is inserted - unless
 * you're typing "over" the existing quote (you should be able to type foo =
 * "hello" without having to arrow over the second quote that was inserted after
 * you typed the first one). - Automatically adjusting indentation in some
 * scenarios, for example when you type the final "d" in "end" - and readjusting
 * it back to the original indentation if you continue typing something other
 * than "end", e.g. "endian".
 *
 * The logic around inserting matching ""'s is heavily based on the Java editor
 * implementation, and probably should be rewritten to be Ruby oriented. One
 * thing they did is process the characters BEFORE the character has been
 * inserted into the document. This has some advantages - it's easy to detect
 * whether you're typing in the middle of a string since the token hierarchy has
 * not been updated yet. On the other hand, it makes it hard to identify whether
 * some characters are what we expect - is a "/" truly a regexp starter or
 * something else? The Ruby lexer has lots of logic and state to determine this.
 * I think it would be better to switch to after-insert logic for this.
 *
 * @todo Match braces within literal strings, as in #{}
 * @todo Match || in the argument list of blocks? do { |foo| etc. }
 * @todo I'm currently highlighting the indentation tokens (else, elsif, ensure,
 * etc.) by finding the corresponding begin. For "illegal" tokens, e.g. def foo;
 * else; end; this means I'll show "def" as the matching token for else, which
 * is wrong. I should make the "indentation tokens" list into a map and
 * associate them with their corresponding tokens, such that an else is only
 * lined up with an if, etc.
 * @todo Pressing newline in a parameter list doesn't work well if it's on a
 * blockdefining line - e.g. def foo(a,b => it will insert the end BEFORE the
 * closing paren!
 * @todo Pressing space in a comment beyond the textline limit should wrap text?
 * http://ruby.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=11553
 * @todo Make ast-selection pick up =begin/=end documentation blocks
