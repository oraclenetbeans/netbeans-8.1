      <description>
          The module is moved to platform cluster and friend API is changed to
          public API. However, not all classes, that were exposed via friend
          API are exposed via public API.
          Following classes are made public:
          <ul>
              <li><code>BugTrackingAccessor</code> (renamed from NBBugzillaAccessor)</li>
              <li><code>Decorable</code></li>
              <li><code>InputGesture</code></li>
              <li><code>LogRecords</code></li>
              <li><code>PasswdEncryption</code></li>
          </ul>
          Following classes, that were a part of friend API are not public:
          <ul>
              <li><code>Decorations</code></li>
              <li><code>MultiPartHandler</code></li>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>release41</code> branch was made on Apr 03 '05 for use in the NetBeans 4.1 release.
Specification versions: 6.0 begins after this point.</li>
<li>The <code>release40</code> branch was made on Nov 01 '04 for use in the NetBeans 4.0 release.
Specification versions: 5.0 begins after this point.</li>
