/**
 * Permits the invoker of an action to follow its progress.
 * <p>An implementation may be added by a caller to the {@code context}
 * of {@link ActionProvider#invokeAction}.
 * If the action provider supports this interface, it should call {@link #start}
 * <em>before returning</em> from {@code invokeAction}, and at some subsequent
 * point (possibly still within {@code invokeAction} but generally later from
 * a separate task thread) call {@link #finished} once on the result.
 * <p>It is best if the provider only calls {@code start} if and when it is actually
 * attempting to run an action at this time, avoiding {@code ActionProgress} entirely
 * when the action is being skippedâ€”for example, if some precondition is unsatisfied
 * and a warning dialog is displayed rather than building or running anything. However
 * when it would be cumbersome or impossible to determine within the dynamic scope of
 * {@code invokeAction} whether or not any real action should be run, for example
 * because those checks are time-consuming and should not block the event thread,
 * the provider may call {@code start} and later {@code finished(false)} to signify
 * that the action was not successfully run.
 * <p>SPI example using Ant:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @}Override public void invokeAction(String command, Lookup context) {
 *     FileObject buildXml = ...;
 *     String[] antTargets = ...decide on targets using command...;
 *     if (antTargets == null) { // wrong conditions, not even pretending to run this action
 *         showWarningDialog();
 *         return;
 *     }
 *     <b>final ActionProgress listener = ActionProgress.start(context);</b>
 *     try {
 *         ActionUtils.runTarget(buildXml, antTargets, null)<b>.addTaskListener(new TaskListener() {
 *             {@code @}Override public void taskFinished(Task task) {
 *                 listener.finished(((ExecutorTask) task).result() == 0);
 *             }
 *         })</b>;
 *     } catch (IOException x) {
 *         LOG.log(Level.FINE, "could not start program", x);
 *         <b>listener.finished(false);</b>
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
