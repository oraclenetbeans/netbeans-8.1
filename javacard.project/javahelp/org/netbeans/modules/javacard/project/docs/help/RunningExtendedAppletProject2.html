  <title>Running Your Extended Applet Project - Java Card 3 Development
  </title>

<body class="body">

<a name="JavaCard3NewProjectWizard2"></a><h2>Running Your Extended Applet Sample</h2>
<p class="p">Use the IDE to build and run the sample. When you click
the Run Main Project button, the IDE starts the Java Card runtime environment, deploys
the application to a device, and creates instances of the application on the
device which a browser or client can access. The IDE uses the Packager
and Off-Card Installer tools to create a package for the device, load the
application on the device, and create instances of the application. By using the
IDE, you do not have to start the Java Card runtime environment or
run the Packager and Off-Card Installer tools as separate activities.</p><p class="p">When the extended applet runs, it displays Default Device and <tt>build.xml</tt>(run) output
in the IDE Output window. The output of an extended applet results in
the opening of a connection to a localhost and the communication of a
hexdecimal string.</p><p class="p">See the <i>Development Kit User&#8217;s Guide, Java Card Platform, Version 3.0.2 Connected Editon</i> located in <tt>javacard\JCDK3.0.2_ConnectedEdition\docs</tt> of the NetBeans installation directory for a description
of the Packager and Off-Card Installer tools used by the IDE.</p>
