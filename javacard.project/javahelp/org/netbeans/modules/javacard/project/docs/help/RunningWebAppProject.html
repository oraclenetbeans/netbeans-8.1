  <title>Running a Web Application Project - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="RunningWebAppProject"></a><h2>Running a Web Application Sample</h2>
<p class="p">Use the IDE to build and run the sample. When you click
the Run Main Project button, the IDE starts the Java Card runtime environment, deploys
the application to a device, and creates instances of the application on the
device which a browser or client can access. The IDE uses the Packager
and Off-Card Installer tools to create a package for the device, load the
application on the device, and create instances of the application. By using the
IDE, you do not have to start the Java Card runtime environment or
run the Packager and Off-Card Installer tools as separate activities.</p><p class="p">When the web application runs, it displays Default Device and <tt>build.xml</tt>(run) output in
the IDE Output window. The output of a web application results in the
opening of a connection to a localhost and browser that displays the applications
user interface.</p><p class="p">See the Development Kit documentation for a description of the Packager and Off-Card Installer tools
used by the IDE.</p>
