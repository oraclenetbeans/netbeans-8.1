  <title>Running a Classic Applet Sample - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="RunningClassicAppletProject"></a><h2>Running a Classic Applet Project</h2>
<a name="indexterm-57"></a>
<p class="p">Use the IDE to build and run the sample. When you click
the Run Main Project button, the IDE starts the Java Card runtime environment, deploys
the application to a device, and creates instances of the application on the
device which a browser or client can access. The IDE uses the Packager
and Off-Card Installer tools to create a package for the device, load the
application on the device, and create instances of the application. By using the
IDE, you do not have to start the Java Card runtime environment or
run the Packager and Off-Card Installer tools as separate activities.</p><p class="p">When a classic applet runs, it displays the Default Device<a name="indexterm-58"></a> and <tt>build.xml</tt>(run) output
in the IDE Output window. The output of a classic applet<a name="indexterm-59"></a> results
in the opening of a connection to a localhost and the communication of a
hexadecimal string.</p>
<p>Refer to the Development Kit documentation for a description of the Packager and
Off-Card Installer tools used by the IDE.</p>
<p>The Java Card 3 development kit contains a basic classic applet sample, <tt>HelloWorld</tt>,
in <i>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</i><tt>\samples\classic_applets</tt>. The <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample and can also be downloaded from the Kenai Java
Card 3 repository. It illustrates basic use of the Java Card API to
run a classic applet application and demonstrates the basic structure of a classic
applet that developers can use to develop, deploy, create, execute, delete, and unload
classic applets. This sample is a minimal classic applet utilizing the simplest source code
and meta-files.</p>
