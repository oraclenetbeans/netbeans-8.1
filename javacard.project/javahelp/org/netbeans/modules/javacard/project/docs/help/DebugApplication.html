  <title>Debug the Application - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="DebugApplication"></a><h2>Debug the Application</h2>
<p class="p">Debugging is the process of examining your application for errors. The process of debugging is accomplished by setting breakpoints and watches in your code and running it in the debugger. This enables you to execute your code one line at a time and examine the state of your application in order to discover any problems.</p>

<p class="p">The Java Card platform debugger uses IDE menus and procedures for debugging applications. When you start a debugging session, the debugger windows appear automatically at the bottom of your screen. You can also debug applications that are running on a remote machine by attaching the debugger to the application process.</p>

<p class="p">See the appropriate Java Card 3 platform documentation on the Java Card 3 Kenai project site for detailed information about the Java Card 3 platform debugging protocol and procedures.</p>
