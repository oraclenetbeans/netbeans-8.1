   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="BuildPackagingPanel"></a><h2>Build - Packaging Panel</h2>
<a name="indexterm-23"></a><p class="p">The Build - Packaging panel is only provided for classic applet<a name="indexterm-24"></a> and
classic library projects. The Build - Packaging panel enables you to edit the Classic
Package AID values. The Classic package AID is a unique ID applied to
the package of the classic applet. It consists of two components, an RID
value<a name="indexterm-25"></a> and a PIX value<a name="indexterm-26"></a>.</p><p class="p">The RID value is the unique ID for your organization, assigned by a
standards body such as the International Standards Organization (ISO). The RID is a
5 byte hexadecimal value. A default RID is provided by the plugin and
can be used during development. However, before deployment you must obtain a valid
RID from the ISO and add it to the project.</p><p class="p">The PIX (proprietary identifier) value uniquely identifies an individual Java Card package. It
is a 0 - 11 byte hexadecimal value generated by the IDE. A
specific value is not required for development. To generate a PIX value for
the package, click the Generate button.</p>
