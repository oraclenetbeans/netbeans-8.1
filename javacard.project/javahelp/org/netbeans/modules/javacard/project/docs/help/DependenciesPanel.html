   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="DependenciesPanel"></a><h2>Dependencies Panel</h2>
<p class="p">The Dependencies panel displays the libraries, their paths, and deployment strategies in the
project as well as enables you to <a href="AddLibrary.html">Add a Library</a>, <a href="RemoveLibrary.html">Remove a Library</a>, change the order of
libraries, and <a href="ChangeLibraryDeploymentStrategy.html">Change a Library Deployment Strategy</a> used in the project.</p><p class="p"><b>Libraries</b> - If you want to use the same set of sources in
multiple projects, you can set it in the project as a library and
share it among different users and projects as a separate project. There are
two types of libraries that can be added to a project:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing library projects. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing JAR files. </p><p class="p">Use a library that depends on a JAR file when the JAR file satisfies one of the following conditions: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file represents an API that resides on the target platform but is not deployed.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file contains classes that must be included in the JAR file generated for the project.</p></li></ul>
</li></ul></body>
