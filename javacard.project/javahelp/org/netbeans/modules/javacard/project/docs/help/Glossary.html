and certain types of files in card file systems. An AID consists of
two distinct pieces: a 5-byte RID (resource identifier) and a 0 to 11-byte
PIX (proprietary identifier extension). The RID is a resource identifier assigned to companies
by ISO. The PIX identifiers are assigned by companies.</p><p class="p">A unique AID is associated with each applet class in an applet application
module. In addition, a unique AID is assigned to each applet instance during
installation. This applet instance AID is used by an off-card client to select
the applet instance for APDU communication sessions.</p><p class="p">Applet instance URIs are constructed from their applet instance AID using the &quot;aid&quot;
registry-based namespace authority as follows:</p><p class="p"><tt>//aid/&lt;RID&gt;/&lt;PIX&gt;</tt></p><p class="p">where <tt>&lt;RID&gt;</tt> (resource identifier) and <tt>&lt;PIX&gt;</tt> (proprietary identifier extension) are components of the
