  <title>Applets Panel - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="AppletsPanel"></a><h2>Applets Panel</h2>
<p class="p">The Applets panel <a name="indexterm-7"></a>is only provided for classic <a name="indexterm-8"></a> and extended applet projects.
The Applets panel displays the name, number of instances, and <a name="indexterm-9"></a>AID of each
applet that will be included in <tt>applet.xml</tt>. The Applets panel enables you to remove
an applet from the list in the <tt>applet.xml</tt> file
and to customize the instances of an enabled applet<a name="indexterm-10"></a> by adding additional
instances, editing deployment parameters, and editing the instance AID <a name="indexterm-11"></a>of the
applet.</p><p class="p">You can customize instance of an applet by adding and removing multiple instances deployed to a card. Each instance must have a unique
<a name="indexterm-12"></a>AID that scripts can use when communicating with an instance of an applet. The
 AID follows the form of but does not have to be
related to the applet AID. </p><p class="p">Separate instance of an applet can have different deployment parameters. These parameters are
passed to the applet instance when it is instantiated on the card.</p>
