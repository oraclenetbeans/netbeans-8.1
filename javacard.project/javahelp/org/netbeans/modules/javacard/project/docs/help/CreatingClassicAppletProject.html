  <title>Creating a Classic Applet Project - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="CreatingClassicAppletProject"></a><h2>Creating a Classic Applet Project</h2>
<p class="p">The IDE enables you to create new classic applet projects<a name="indexterm-29"></a> from templates (see
<a href="CreateClassicAppletProjectFromTemplate.html">Create a Classic Applet Project From the Template</a>) or classic applet projects from existing sources (see <a href="CreateClassicAppletProjectFromExistingCode.html">Create a Classic Applet Project From Existing Code</a>). </p><p class="p">You can add more than one collection of existing sources (source roots) to
a project, however, after you add them to the project they cannot be
used in any other project. In addition, if the sources are already associated
with another project, you cannot add them as a source root to the
new project. To use existing sources in more than one project you must
create them as libraries and include them in project properties as a dependency.
