                <p>
                    Added a possibility to plug into Java source indexing. The indexer plugin is called
                    on fully attributed compilation unit tree processed by <code>JavaCustomIndexer</code>.
                    Because the parsing and attribution of Java source was already done by JavaCustomIndexer
                    the plugin does not introduce any performance impact.
