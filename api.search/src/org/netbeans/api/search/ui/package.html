            Helpers for creating UI controls for your search provider that are
            similar to controls in the default provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Static methods in class <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/ui/ComponentUtils.html">ComponentUtils</a></code>
            can adjust fresh UI components to be used in panels for
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/provider/SearchProvider.Presenter.html">SearchProvider.Presenter</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advantage of modifying of existing components and returning
            controller objects (instead of using subclasses of swing components)
            is that it can be comfortably used with NetBeans GUI Builder.
