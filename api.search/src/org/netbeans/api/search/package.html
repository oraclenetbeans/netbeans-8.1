            This package contains classes that can be used by modules that need
            to work with <i>Search in Projects</i> dialog, or want to share
            information about what data was recently searched.
            There are also some utility classes for general usage.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to get or store recently searched items, see
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/SearchHistory.html">SearchHistory</a></code>,
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/SearchPattern.html">SearchPattern</a></code>
            and <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/ReplacePattern.html">ReplacePattern</a></code>
        </p>
        <p>
            To display <i>Find in Project</i> dialog, and start a search with
            predefine criteria, use
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/SearchControl.html">SearchControl</a></code>
            with <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/SearchScopeOptions.html">SearchScopeOptions</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Class <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/SearchRoot.html">SearchRoot</a></code> defines
            a location in a filesystem where the search should start.
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/api/search/RegexpUtil.html">RegexpUtil</a></code> can create a pattern
            for matching file names. These classes can be useful when implementing some custom search infrastructure.
