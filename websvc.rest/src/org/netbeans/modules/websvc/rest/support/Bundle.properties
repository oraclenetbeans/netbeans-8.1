To access REST resources deploy the test client to the same domain as the resource (Web Test Client in Project option).<br><br>\
If your browser permits access to remote resources, you can choose your local filesystem<br>\
as the target (Locally Generated Test Client option).<br>\
In Internet Explorer, you can enable cross-domain requests in Internet Options dialog box.<br>\
Another option to allow cross-domain requests, to REST resources provided by the web application,<br>\
is to set up a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filter.<br>\
To create CORS filter, you can use Web Services -> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Filter wizard.</html>
