                  The <code>o.n.core</code> module finds a instance of java.net.ProxySelector
                  in the default <code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code>. If some found
                  then will be registred as default <code>ProxySelector.setDedault()</code>.

                  An implementation of this class brings a facility to reload Network 
                  Proxy Settings from underlying OS.
                  The module <code>core.network</code> provides a implementation
                  which may be accessible via <code>Lookup.getDefault()</code>. It's not guaranteed
                  any implementation is found on all distribution.

                  Classes <code>NbProxySelector</code> and <code>ProxyAutoConfig</code> have been
                  moved to Core Network module. Now the <code>NbProxySelector</code> can be accessed
                  via lookup - in <code>CoreBridgeImpl</code>.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This document lists changes made to the API between core/startup and core
modules. It is a friend API so it does not need to be developed compatibly,
and indeed it is not.
