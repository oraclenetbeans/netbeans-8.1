 * Mark is an element of the {@link MarkVector}.

 * It holds an offset in the document which is updated with document modifications.
 * In addition the mark may be "unsharable" which means that a client asking
 * for a position at a given offset will not get an existing position referencing
 * this mark but instead it will get a new instance of mark and position.
 * Mark becomes unsharable once it's at begining or inside a region being removed
 * by a text removal. Upon undo these marks restore their original offsets
 * while a regular fresh mark (inserted at the offset) would go to its end
 * when undoing the removal.
