# List of patterns (one per line) to skip over in VerifyLibsAndLicenses.testNoStrayThirdPartyBinaries.
# Uses standard Ant pattern syntax, in ${nb_all} among modules included in cluster config.
# Implicit includes is **/*.jar,**/*.zip.
# Only files under version control will be checked, so no need to exclude build products.

# General subdirs not used in the build:
**/test/

#verify if templates are Sun owned or under which license are distributed
projectimport/bluej/src/org/netbeans/bluej/EmptyBluejProject.zip

#OK

#consider consolidation
vmd.components.*/*/dist/*

# Samples (should probably be packed during build instead):
swingapp/src/org/netbeans/modules/swingapp/resources/*App.zip

#not 100% sure for this entry, but probably OK
web.core.syntax/tlddoc/

# Not used by the build:

# Seems harmless:

# Sample database:
