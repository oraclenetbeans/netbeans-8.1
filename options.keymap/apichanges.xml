                <p>
                    In order to remove a keymap entry, create a file in the profile's
                    directory, with extension <code>remove</code>:
                </p>
                    <pre><code>
                        &lt;file name="DS-O.remove"/>
                    </code></pre>
                <p>
                    No attributes are necessary. The system will treat <code>DS-O</code>
                    key in the appropriate keymap profile as undefined. The convention should
                    be only used in keymap profiles, not in the base keymap.
                </p>
