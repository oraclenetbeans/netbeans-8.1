          The OSGi specification considers adding new methods to interfaces
          compatible. That has happened and it is not compatible 
          according to NetBeans API principles,
          thus making incompatible, in spite the incompatibility is only in
          the imported <em>standard</em> API.

          <p>
          Some incompatibilities were reported between Equinox 3.6 and 3.7.1
          (which has also been upgraded). These include bug <b>208616</b>.
          All known issues with Felix 4.0.2 were mitigated.

          OSGi specification bundle with NetBeans has been upgraded to 
          version 4.3. Both containers were upgraded too. Felix to version
          4.0.2 and Equinox to 3.7.1.

          One can check whether the access to resource archive is safe or not
          by calling <code>isActive()</code> method.

          In previous version OSGi bundles could access NetBeans APIs which
          enumerated list of "friends" without any restrictions. This has been
          restricted. If you need a friend access, consider writing real 
          NetBeans module.

          Only NetBeans modules with public API can be accessed from OSGi bundles.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>
