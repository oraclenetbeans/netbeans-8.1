simple:
- checking & completion of attribute values!
- add hyperlinking to the definition file from the usages in html code

normal:
- semantic checking for the configuration file
- configuration in userdir + merging w/ the project conf
- refactoring configuration when renaming usages?

harder:
- fix the context-awareness of the features (checks, completion) - now it is very poorly supported even if the configuration allows to define it.
